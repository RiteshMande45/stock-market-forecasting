# 📈 Stock Market Time Series Analysis & Forecasting

An end-to-end data analytics project with an **interactive Streamlit dashboard** for real-time stock predictions using ARIMA, SARIMA, and LSTM models.

## 🎯 Project Features
- 📊 Interactive web dashboard built with Streamlit
- 🤖 Multiple AI models (ARIMA, SARIMA, LSTM)
- 📈 Real-time candlestick charts
- 🎨 Beautiful visualizations with Plotly
- 📉 Technical indicators (RSI, Moving Averages, Volatility)

## 🚀 How to Run the Dashboard

### 1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/stock-market-forecasting.git
cd stock-market-forecasting
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Streamlit app
```
streamlit run app.py
```

The dashboard will open automatically in your browser at http://localhost:8501
